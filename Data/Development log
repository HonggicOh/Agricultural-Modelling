Decision making
  increase the readability of the data.

Risk
  Data consistency issue(missing value, wrong data, etc)

Reflection
  For radiation, humidity, wind data, I only used one gps point nearby farming area. To improve realiability, add 3 points(weather stations's gps)of weather data and use average value of them.
