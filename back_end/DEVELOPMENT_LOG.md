| 16th Aug, 2022      | 1. Create files to store back-end codes  <br/> 2. Complete the framework research and report.  <br/> 3. Built the web interface document                                                                                     | fb9c6ad7ec60e0c6af2a7bc84fbdd962ea15b7cd |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |            |
| Week 3 (12/08/2022) | 1. Familiar with the back-end development process, investigate the main web development frameworks, such as Flask, Django, Pyramid, etc.<br/>2. Organize logical ideas and use Postman software to write basic API documents |                                          | 1.we dicided to use Flask framework, as the following reasons: our predicted algorithm is writen by Python, and Flask is also writen by Python; Flask is light and easy to use, and it has higher flexibility,higher compatibility with latest technologies, and high scalability for simple web applications; moreover, our main goal for this project is to develop efficiently, rather than maintenance.<br/>2. We decided to use Postman as the following reasons: Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones we have made ourselves. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality. Besides that, Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster. | Risk for Flasks: 1. it has potential high security vulnerability; 2. flask framework has no CSRF protection.<br/>Risk for Postman: Postman is ealisy impacted by log4j2 vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                 |By doing related research, comparing the existing commonly used web development frameworks, and combining with the actual needs of our project, we finally decided to use the Flask framework. We deeply understand the importance of doing research, and although it takes a lot of time, it can help us on the right path. In addition, we also completed the development of API documentation and used it as a post-test. During this period, we learned how to develop APIs, set up ports, etc.            |
| Week 4 (19/08/2022) | 1. Established a basic server and complete the server respone. 2. Write the common methods of get and post;3.Save the returned data in Jason format, and learn step by step to develop the database.                         |                                          | 1. We decided to use the web server development tool that comes with flask, since it makes the process of designing a web application simpler. Also, flask lets us focus on what the users are requesting and what sort of response to give back and learn more about micro frameworks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I think Flask is not recommended for production because of stability rather than security. With WSGI or Gunicorn, we can utilize multi-thread/multi-proc more effectively, and serve multiple requests simultaneously. Besides that using more modules is seen as a third party involvement which could be a major breach in security. |We have completed the construction of the server with a small amount of code, which reduces our development cost and improves efficiency. In addition, we are also investigating which database to use to store the information, taking into account time and management costs. Next, we will write functions one after another to further process the obtained data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
